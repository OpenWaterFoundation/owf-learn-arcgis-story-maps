# Open Water Foundation / Learn ArcGIS Story Maps #

This documentation provides resources to learn how to use the [ArcGIS Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/) web mapping application.
Story Maps let you combine maps with narrative text, images and multimedia content to tell a story.

This documentation has been written based on experience using ArcGIS Story Maps at the Open Water Foundation (OWF),
with focus on tasks that are useful in water resources and solutions.

This documentation focuses on both the free ArcGIS Online public account and the paid ArcGIS Online organizational account.
See [Create an ArcGIS Online Account](create-account) to decide which type of account is most beneficial for your use.
