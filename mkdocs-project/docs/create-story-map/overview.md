# Create a Story Map / Overview #

We will now create a basic Story Map using the templates provided by ArcGIS.  We will create a Story Map using 
the South Platte-Metro IPP map that we created in Map Viewer, as well as add some photos, a video and content 
from another web page.

We will use the same content for each template example to see how the same content can be represented in 
different ways to tell a story.
