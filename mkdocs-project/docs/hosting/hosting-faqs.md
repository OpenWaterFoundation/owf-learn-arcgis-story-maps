# Learn ArcGIS Story Maps / FAQs About Hosting and Editing #
The following frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their answers are provided to address some of the 
confusion, concerns or limitations about hosting and editing your own Story Map.  Where applicable, 
OWF has provided its own experiences in dealing with these concerns and limitations.  These FAQs can 
also be found [here](https://github.com/Esri/storymap-series/#faq).

* **Where is the data contained in the Story Map (the content) stored?**
    The data are stored in a Web Application Item in ArcGIS Online (in your account's Content page). 
	This includes the narrative content, references to webmaps, pictures, videos and web pages, and 
	the settings.

* **How can you make edits (as opposed to just customization) to the Story Map?**  
    There are two ways to edit a Story Map.  The first is to log in to ArcGIS Online, navigate to your 
	account's Content page and click on the Story Map.  Then click on the blue "Edit" button at the top 
	of the page to make edits to the story.  
	
	You can also make edits using the downloadable version of your Story Map.  When the downloaded 
	template (``index.html``) is configured with the application ID (appid), you can add the word 
	"edit" to the URL address; this will open the builder, where you can edit the story.  You will be 
	prompted for user authentication through the Identity Manager.  **_OWF tried these steps and they 
	did not work.  The Identity Manager did not appear.  Perhaps it only works if you have an 
	Organizational Account?_**
	
	**It is important to understand that the Story Map can only be edited by its owner (the named account 
	that initially created the Story Map).  If you have an Organizational Account, then the Organization 
	Administrator can take or give ownership to another user, but then the original owner can longer make 
	edits to the Story Map.**

* **Can you use the Story Map app templates without ArcGIS Online?**
    From Esri: "This is not a supported use case at this time.  Please let us know if you are interested 
	in such a scenario".
