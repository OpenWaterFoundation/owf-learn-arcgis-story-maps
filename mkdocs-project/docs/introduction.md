# Learn ArcGIS Story Maps / Introduction #

In order to create a Story Map, you must have an ArcGIS Online account.  Therefore, this documentation begins with a discussion of the two 
options for setting up an account.

Once an account has been created, you can begin building a Story Map using the templates, or "apps", that are provided.  The foundation of a Story 
Map is a map (or several maps).  It is possible to use an ArcGIS Online web map or a map that has been created and shared publicly by another user for 
a Story Map.  More than likely, though, you will use your own maps (or your own data to create maps) in a Story Map.  Therefore, this documentation 
also discusses how to make your own maps within ArcGIS Online's Map Viewer.  

A map is basically a one-page story.  This documentation will then cover how to combine these one-page stories into a longer narrative 
with text, images or other content to create a Story Map.  Some, but not all, of the Story Map templates will be described with examples.

Next, there is a discussion about hosting your own Story Map to gain access to the code behind it, which allows for further limited 
customization of the Story Map.

Finally, there is some discussion on how to share and/or collaborate on a Story Map with another organization or individual.


**Need to find (or create) some diagram that illustrates how ArcGIS Desktop, Online and Story Maps are connected and include linkages 
to content such as csv and geojson files from your computer or on the web (specifically on GitHub).**


## Alternatives to ArcGIS Story Maps ##

Alternatives to Story Maps include:

* [MapStory](https://mapstory.org/) - need to investigate
* [TimeMapper](http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org/) - need to investigate
* [StoryMap JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) - need to investigate
* [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) - need to investigate
* MkDocs with iframes - need to investigate

## Next Steps ##

The remainder of this documentation describes how to sign up for an ArcGIS Online account, create a basic map to insert into a Story Map and
create a Story Map using one of the pre-defined templates that are available.
